#Overview

Stock market prediction is a challenging task that involves analyzing historical stock price data to forecast future trends. This project employs machine learning algorithms to predict stock prices, providing insights for investors and traders.
The main file in this repository, DT_project.ipynb, is a Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates the end-to-end process of building and evaluating the prediction model.

#Features

1. Preprocessing of historical stock data

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) for understanding patterns and trends

3. Implementation of decision tree-based algorithms

4. Model evaluation metrics

#Dataset

The dataset used for this project is sourced from publicly available stock market data (e.g., Yahoo Finance or Kaggle). Ensure you have the dataset in the required format before running the notebook. The dataset should include features like:

1. Date

2. Open price

3. High price

4. Low price

5. Close price

6.Volume

#Model and Techniques

This project primarily uses a Decision Tree-based algorithm for stock price prediction. Key steps include:
Data preprocessing (handling missing values, feature scaling, etc.)
Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets
Training a Decision Tree model
Evaluating the model’s performance using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE)

#Installation

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository: git clone https://github.com/SachinVerma88/Stock-Market-Prediction.git
2. Navigate to the project directory: cd Stock-Market-Prediction
3. Install the required Python libraries: pip install -r requirements.txt
4. Launch Jupyter Notebook: jupyter notebook
Open and run the DT_project.ipynb notebook.

#Usage

Prepare your dataset with historical stock prices.
Load the dataset in the notebook.
Follow the steps outlined in DT_project.ipynb to preprocess the data, train the model, and make predictions.
Evaluate the model’s performance and visualize the results.

#Results

The notebook includes visualizations and evaluation metrics that demonstrate the model’s performance. The results can help identify trends and make informed predictions about stock prices.
